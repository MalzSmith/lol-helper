# lol helper
Simple WPF application that shows data about people you play with. This is mostly a hobby project, made for personal use.

# Usage
You need to get a Riot API key to use this software. You can get one at https://developer.riotgames.com/.

After building you can simply run the code, paste your api key in the text box for it and let the program run. I wanted something that just shows me data without requiring input so that's what it does.
